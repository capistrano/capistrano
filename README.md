# Capistrano [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/capistrano/capistrano.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/capistrano/capistrano) [![Code Climate](http://img.shields.io/codeclimate/github/capistrano/capistrano.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/capistrano/capistrano) <a href="http://codersclan.net/?repo_id=325&source=small"><img src="http://img.shields.io/badge/get-support-blue.svg"></a>

## Documentation

Check out the [online documentation](http://capistranorb.com) of Capistrano 3 hosted via this [repository](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano.github.io).

## Support

## Requirements

* Ruby >= 1.9.3 (JRuby and C-Ruby/YARV are supported)

Capistrano support these source code version control systems out of the box:

* Git 1.8 or higher
* Mercurial
* SVN

Binaries for these VCS might be required on the local and/or the remote systems.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

``` ruby
gem 'capistrano', '~> 3.4.0'
```

And then execute:

``` sh
$ bundle install
```

Capify:
*make sure there's no "Capfile" or "capfile" present*
``` sh
$ bundle exec cap install
```

This creates the following files:

```
├── Capfile
├── config
│   ├── deploy
│   │   ├── production.rb
│   │   └── staging.rb
│   └── deploy.rb
└── lib
    └── capistrano
            └── tasks
```

To create different stages:

``` sh
$ bundle exec cap install STAGES=local,sandbox,qa,production
```

## Usage

``` sh
# list all available tasks
$ bundle exec cap -T

# deploy to the staging environment
$ bundle exec cap staging deploy

# deploy to the production environment
$ bundle exec cap production deploy

# simulate deploying to the production environment
# does not actually do anything
$ bundle exec cap production deploy --dry-run

# list task dependencies
$ bundle exec cap production deploy --prereqs

# trace through task invocations
$ bundle exec cap production deploy --trace
```

## Validation of variables

To validate a variable, each time before it is set, define a validation:

```ruby
validate :some_key do |key, value|
  if value.length < 5
    raise Capistrano::ValidationError, "Length of #{key} is too short!"
  end
end
```

Multiple validation can be assigned to a single key. Validations will be executed
in the order of registration.

Validations can be used to ensure certain properties of user-supplied values,
e.g. from `ask` or `ENV`. ``

## Testing

Capistrano has two test suites: an RSpec suite and a Cucumber suite. The
RSpec suite handles quick feedback unit specs. The Cucumber suite features
an integration suite that uses Vagrant to deploy to a real virtual
server. In order to run the Cucumber suite you will need to install
[Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) and Vagrant supported
virtualization software like
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

```
# To run the RSpec suite
$ rake spec

# To run the Cucumber suite
$ rake features

# To run the Cucumber suite and leave the VM running (faster for subsequent runs)
$ rake features KEEP_RUNNING=1
```

## SSHKit

[SSHKit](https://github.com/leehambley/sshkit) is the driver for SSH
connections behind the scenes in Capistrano. Depending on how deep you dig, you
might run into interfaces that come directly from SSHKit (the configuration is
a good example).
