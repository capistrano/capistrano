### Summary

(Guidelines for creating a bug report are available
here: https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT.md)

Provide a general description of the code changes in your pull
request... were there any bugs you had fixed? If so, mention them. If
these bugs have open GitHub issues, be sure to tag them here as well,
to keep the conversation linked together.

### Short checklist

- [ ] Did you run `bundle exec rubocop -a` to fix linter issues?
- [ ] If relevant, did you create a test?
- [ ] Did you confirm that the RSpec tests pass?

### Other Information

If there's anything else that's important and relevant to your pull
request, mention that information here.

Thanks for helping improve Capistrano!
