### Steps to reproduce
If reasonable, you can help by creating a Capistrano skeleton example project which reproduces the issue you are seeing. You can then upload the individual files to a GitHub Gist or a GitHub project. Others can simply modify the configuration to point at a test server/repository of their own. Often times, an issue is resolved simply by making this test case.

An example test case is here: https://gist.github.com/will-in-wi/527327e31af30b3eae2068e2965be05b
