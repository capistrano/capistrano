      on_rollback { run "ln -nfs #{previous_release} #{current_path}" }

* Fix gemspec to include a dependency on rake 0.7 [Jamis Buck]

* Added respect for ENV["HOSTS"] that'll be used instead of the roles specified in the task definition [DHH]. Example:

* Added respect for ENV["ROLES"] that'll be used instead of the roles specified in the task definition [DHH]. Example:

    task :setup, :roles => [ :app, :web, :db ]
      # normally this would run every where
    end
    
    ROLES=app cap setup # this will only run for the app role, overwritting the default declaration

* Added :hosts option to task definition that allows you to specify cross-cutting tasks [DHH]. Example:

    task :setup, :hosts => [ "06.example.com", "01.example.com" ] do
      # this task will happen on 06 and 01 regardless of which roles they belong to
