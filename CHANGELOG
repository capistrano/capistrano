*0.10.0* (January 2nd, 2006)

* Add a sanity check to make sure the correct versions of Net::SSH and Net::SFTP are installed.

* Added a cleanup task to remove unused releases from the deployment directory

* Allow password to be reentered on sudo if it was entered incorrectly

* Use && as the command separator for the checkouts, so that errors are caught early.

* Ping each SSH connection every 1s during command processing so that long-running commands don't cause the connection to timeout.

* Add a 0.01s sleep during the command loop so that the CPU doesn't go ballistic while ST is doing its thing.

* Use SFTP for file transfers (if available).

* Add an "update_current" task that will do an svn up on the current release

* Default parameters work correctly with the generator #2218 [Scott Barron]

* Show the help screen instead of an error when no arguments are given

* Make SwitchTower easier to invoke programmatically via SwitchTower::CLI

* Specify the revision to release via the :revision variable (defaults to latest revision)
