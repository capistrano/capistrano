# capistranorb.com

This directory generates the [capistranorb.com](http://capistranorb.com/) site. Feel free to send pull requests to make improvements to Capistrano's documentation!

### Quick start

This is a GitHub Pages project, which means it is built using Jekyll. To run the site locally, you'll need a functioning Ruby environment.

After checking out the capistrano repository, run:

```
cd docs
bundle install
```

Then start the Jekyll server with:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

You should now be able to preview the site on `http://localhost:4000`. After making any changes to markdown or HTML files, just refresh your browser to see the results. You do not have to restart the Jekyll process.
